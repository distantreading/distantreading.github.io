                <head>What is Work Group 1 for?</head>

                <p rend="box"> The aim of this COST Action is to "develop the resources and methods
                    necessary to change the way European literary history is written." (MOU,
                    p.2)</p>

                <p>An important part of that goal is to create a big collection of literature from
                    1850-1920 which can be used to benchmark different computational distant-reading
                    methods for corpus annotation and analysis: we call this the <hi>European
                        Literary Text Collection (ELTeC)</hi></p>

                <head>Encoding scheme</head>
                <p>Following discussion in Prague, we defined three <soCalled>levels</soCalled> of
                    encoding; TEI schemas exist for eltec-0 and eltec-1. Level 2 proposals will be
                    determined by the outcomes of this meeting!</p>
                <p>The schemas are defined using the TEI ODD system which enables us to generate
                    comprehensive documentation (see e.g. <ptr
                        target="https://distantreading.github.io/Schema/eltec-0.html"/>) : work is
                    ongoing on customizing this. </p>
                <p>We produced a preliminary <ref
                        target="https://distantreading.github.io/Training/index.html">set of
                        training materials</ref> for a two day Workshop held in Wuerzburg in April.
                    A dozen participants were taken through the process of converting a PDF file to
                    a fully marked up ELTEc text, using Abbyy fine reader and oXygen. </p>

                    <item>There should be a guaranteed minimum level of encoding for all texts in

                    <item>At the same time, the encoding should not misrepresent the text as
                        originally created and received.</item>
                    <item>The encoding must be easy to apply in a consistent way, starting from both
                        basic OCR and pre-existing digital versions.</item>

                    derived from another. We use this technique to define three

                        <item>level zero : the basic minimum guaranteed to be available for every

                            creation;</item>
                        <item>level one : some additional distinctions are made (for example amongst
                            passages which are typographically salient) for which human judgment may
                            be needed; </item>
                        <item>level two : linguistic and semantic annotation is added,at the level
                            of individual tokens and segments, typically by means of an automatic
                            process. </item>

                    <item>The different <soCalled>levels</soCalled> of the ELTeC schema are not
                        really levels in the sense that a text will progress majestically from 0 to

                    <item>It is easy to go from 1 or 2 to 0: a stylesheet simply has to remove some

                    <item>It is also easy (assuming the right software environment) to go from from

                    <item>It is <emph>not</emph> easy to go from 0 or 2 to 1: human judgment may be

                <head>Why the three levels?</head>
                <list>
                    <item>texts may come from many sources, some of which already have extensive
                        tagging </item>
                    <item>some (though by no means all) of that tagging is useful for distant
                        reading purposes and we would like to be able to retain it rather than have
                        the expense of adding it. For example : <list>
                            <item>distinguishing verse and prose </item>
                            <item>distinguishing highlighted phrases and their functions (e.g.
                                emphasis, foreign, titles) </item>
                            <item>identifying footnotes</item>
                            <item>(maybe) distinguishing direct speech from narrative</item>
                        </list>
                    </item>
                    <item>texts which don't make such distinctions are still useful (of course!);
                        the core functions of distant reading (as so far defined) don't require
                        these distinctions, though they may benefit from them. </item>
                    <item>identifying a text as level 1 or as level 0 guarantees a specific level of

                            white muslin, enlivened by a gold band round her waist, it fitted
                            exquisitely, displaying her beautiful figure to the fullest perfection,

                <p>We first tested our proposals using a sample of texts contributed by volunteers
                    in a variety of formats and languages, which were all converted to ELTeC (with
                    varying degrees of difficulty). The results are still available as <ref

                        Sampler</ref> (12 texts)</p>
                <p>We defined a procedure for individual researchers to upload their texts to
                    identically structured repositories on Github, one per language: <ptr

                    /></p>
                <p>The process of validating texts and uploading them has begun! See <ptr
