The following items are available in your Work/Novels folder: </p><div class="table"><table><tr class="data"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="data">Language</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="data">Identifier</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="data">Author</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="data">Title</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1" class="data">Wordcount</td></tr></table></div><p>Each file with extension .pdf contains a digitized representation of an original printed source, which has been processed by Abbyy OCR. Take a look at this to determine what metadata you can extract for use in the header of your file, and also to familiarize yourself with the basic structure of the text -- whether it has prefaces etc. </p><p>Use online resources (WorldCat, Wikipedia, etc.) to collect other required metadata, such as the fullname of the author, their dates, sex, etc. When you have this information, proceed to create a new document and a TEI Header The procedure to follow is described in detail in the <a class="link_ref" href="tutorial-hdr.html">Header Tutorial</a>.</p></div><div class="teidiv0" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Adding the text</span></h2><p>Each file with extension .abbyy.xml contains an XML representation of the results of the OCR procedure carried out by Abbyy. This representation is quite verbose and contains much information we don't need, but it is easy to translate it to a basic TEI form using an XSLT stylesheet. We won't be teaching you XSLT (a standard language for converting one XML document to another) but we have provided a suitable stylesheet for this task. In oXygen, the easiest way to use it is to set up a <span class="q">‘transformation scenario’</span>, as follows:</p><ul><li class="item">In the <span class="ident">Document</span> menu, choose <span class="ident">Transformation</span> -&gt; <span class="ident">Configure Transformation Scenario(s)</span>, or type CTRL-SHIFT-C, or click the spanner icon (this one : <img src="../Graphics/spanner.png" alt="" class="graphic" style=" height:7mm;" />) on the toolbar.</li><li class="item">A list of available transformation scenarios is displayed. You probably don't have the abbyy2tei scenario yet, so click <span class="ident">new</span> at the bottom and select <span class="ident">Transformtion with XSLT</span> to create it.</li><li class="item">In the New scenario dialogue, first change the name of the scenario to <span class="ident">abbyy2tei</span></li><li class="item">leave the content of the XML URL box unchanged </li><li class="item">The XSL URL box should be filled. Click the triangle to the right of the folder icon and select <span class="ident">Browse for local file</span></li><li class="item">Navigate to the file <span class="ident">abbyy2tei.xsl</span> (it is in th top level of your Work directory), select it, and click Open</li><li class="item">Click the <span class="ident">Output</span> tab and make sure that the <span class="ident">open in editor</span> box is checked</li></ul><p>Once you have created this scenario, you can use it as often as you like, with other XML files. You can also set it as the default scenario for a file. </p><ul><li class="item">Open the abby.xml file of your choice in oXygen</li><li class="item">With this file open in the editor, click the red triangle icon, type CTRL-SHIFT-T, or select Document -&gt; Transformation -&gt; Apply Transformation Scenario from the menu</li><li class="item">If you have set a default transformation, it will be applied; if not the Transform with dialog box appears. Select the <span class="ident">abby2tei</span> transformation you created earlier to associate it and then click the <span class="ident">Apply Associated</span> button</li></ul><p>You may find it useful to tidy up the text a little at this stage. It's up to you, but some things that would be easy to fix are: </p><ul><li class="item">end-of-line hyphenation (where a word is broken across a line) is indicated by gthe special character <code>¬</code>. This makes it easy to join words up again: use a regexp to remove all occurrences of <code>¬\n</code></li><li class="item">The tag <span class="gi">&lt;pb&gt;</span> indicates the start of a new page in the original, and is followed by any running heder or page number in the original source, tagged as a separate <span class="gi">&lt;p&gt;</span> element. You may think it worth writing another regexp to remove paragraphs containing only digits and spaces or uppercase letters to catch these, though be careful you don't remove real parts of the text.</li><li class="item">Wrap the titlepage in a div type="titlepage"</li><li class="item">Decide whether any prefatory matter is authorial: if it is, wrap it in a div type="liminal". If it isn't, remove it.</li><li class="item">You may be able to detect chapter divisions using a regexp to search for specific words, as in the Polish texts, but this is not guaranteed. A text may not have any chapter divisions at all, in which case our schema requires you to wrap the whole thing in one div type="chapter".</li><li class="item">You may catch some recurrent OCR errors using the spell checker built into oXygen (remember to set the correct language : you will need to copy the appropriate spelling files from your Work/Spell directory to ~/.com.oxygenxml/spell)</li></ul><p>When you're reasonably happy with the transcription, type CTRL-A to select all of it and CTRL-C to copy it. Then return to the file in which you prepared your header, move the cursor to the appropriate point inside the <span class="gi">&lt;text&gt;</span> element, and type CTRL-V to paste it. Is the completed document valid? If not, fix it!</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Lou Burnard Consulting.
