We will supply a set of raw materials for candidates to work on, along with detailed instructions. At the end of the Training School, each participant should be able to contribute new TEI encoded texts to the ELTeC GitHub repository. Participants will work in pairs with guidance from Martina, Carolin, Christian and Lou. </p><p>On Monday, participants will learn how to use Oxygen for encoding texts in TEI XML, and will be introduced to the sampling and balance criteria as well as other metadata requirements for ELTeC. On Tuesday, they will work with two different transformation scenarios for creating TEI XML texts, firstly starting from page images, and secondly starting with HTML. We will also discuss the different encoding levels provided for ELTeC texts, including proposals for encoding linguistic analysis. In the closing sessions on Wednesday, participants will be asked to present what they have achieved, and discuss the outcomes of this and other parallel workshops. </p><p>The Training School is intended for any researcher interested in contributing texts to the ELTeC. Some previous experience of computer use is needed, but no knowledge of TEI XML is assumed. </p><dl><dt><span>Local Organizers:</span></dt><dd></dd><dt><span>Trainers:</span></dt><dd>Christian Reul, Carolin Odebrecht, Martina Scholger, and Lou Burnard </dd><dt><span>Participants: </span></dt><dd></dd><dt><span>Location:</span></dt><dd></dd></dl></div><div class="slide"><h2>Creating texts for ELTeC</h2><p>In this workshop you'll learn: </p><ul><li class="item">what TEI XML markup is and why we use it for the ELTeC</li><li class="item">how ELTeC texts should be marked up, at levels 0 and 1</li><li class="item">some practical ways of creating ELTeC texts starting from other formats,for example : <ul><li class="item">plain text output by an OCR system</li><li class="item">digital documents created with Word or Open Office</li><li class="item">ePub or HTML documents found on the internet</li></ul></li></ul><p>You should have some previous experience of working with digital documents, for example creating web pages, or editing documents with Word, but you are not expected to know anything about TEI or XML! </p><p>Almost all the practical work will be done using <a class="link_ref" href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html">oXygen XML Editor</a>.
