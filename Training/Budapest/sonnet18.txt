18.

Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?
Thou art more louely and more temperate:
Rough windes do shake the darling buds of Maie,
And Sommers lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heauen shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
And euery faire from faire some-time declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, vntrimmâ€™d:

But thy eternall Sommer shall not fade,
Nor loose possession of that faire thou ow'st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternall lines to time thou grow'st,

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long liues this, and this giues life to thee,
