<p>The mosaic display shows how many texts satisfy each possible combination of
three balance criteria.
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>length</b> criterion is represented by the three columns running left to right</li>
    <li>The <b>date</b> criterion is represented by the four rows running top to bottom</li>
    <li>The <b>gender</b> criterion is represented by the two colours      </li>
  </ul>
Each cell contains a count of the number of texts satisfying the length and date criteria and is coloured to indicate the gender concerned: pink for male, blue for female.
</p>
<p>If no text is found for a given combination, the row or column concerned is not divided. For example, if all texts are in the same date slot, there will be only one row; if all texts are of the same length, there will be only one column.</p>
<p>The width and height of each cell are drawn in proportion to the number of texts. For example, if there are twice as many texts from T4 as from T3, the T4 row will be twice as tall as the T3 row.</p>
